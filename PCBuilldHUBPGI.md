# Project General Information

Group Name: Group 6
Project Title: PC Build Hub

## A. Problem Statement:
Building a PC is highly technical, especially in terms of the compatibility of parts. Most beginners get stuck on choosing the appropriate components and assembling their PCs. Moreover, there are few reliable local resources that one can turn to when buying computer parts and getting advice, especially around North Caloocan, Philippines. Some of the common problems include; []

• Confusion about the compatibility of the component.
• Lack of availability of reliable and trusted local vendors.
• Lack of proper assembly instructions in detail and resulting in mistakes while building it.

## B. Project Description:
PC Build Hub: This website acts as an all-in-one e-commerce website, making the entire process of PC building simple and efficient. Here you can order all your PC parts, and it then guides you through step-by-step video tutorials in assembling the PC. The app is also designed to sort out compatibility issues with:
    
• A comprehensive list of all the available parts along with accurate pricing and actual availability information.
• Construct configurator tool to check compatible components.
• Provides a personalized suggestion on building based on the user's preference and budget.
• A trusted marketplace where all the necessary parts will be present, not just for new builders but also for experienced ones.

## C. Project Objectives:
To develop the PC Build Hub App with the following measurable objectives:

1. Catalog and Availability: Create a comprehensive parts catalog with real-time pricing and availability, aiming for at least 90% accuracy.
2. Compatibility Tool: Implement a build configurator tool to reduce compatibility-related return rates by 20%.
3. Guidance: Provide step-by-step video tutorials to enhance user confidence and reduce assembly errors by 30%.
4. Secure Transactions: Develop a secure online payment and order tracking system to ensure user trust and satisfaction.
5. User Engagement: Enable user profiles for saved builds and wishlists, targeting a user retention rate of 75%.
6. Community Support: Establish community forums for user interaction and support, aiming to increase engagement by 50% within the first year.

## D. Business Benefits:

1. Streamlined Solutions: Full solution from PC purchasing and building to ensuring it's user-friendly for the client.
2. Increased Accessibility: It helps beginners have increased accessibility through video tutorials, thus decreasing mistakes in common build and increasing user confidence.
3. This would set up a reliable local marketplace for PC parts in North Caloocan, fostering trust among clients and supporting local entities.
4. Return Rate Decrease: Pre-purchase compatibility checks would decrease the return rates while creating satisfaction and loyalty for customers.

## E. Project Deliverables:
1. Requirements
Research and Analysis: Gather insights on PC building and ecommerce systems.
Data Gathering: Collect information on PC components, user needs, and market trends.
User Stories: Define user interactions with the system (customers, admins).
User Requirements: Detail system needs from the perspective of end-users.
Use Case: Identify core actions (e.g., purchasing components, managing inventory).
Data Dictionary: Document all fields and data types for each database table.
Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD): Visualize relationships between system entities (users, orders, components).
Dataflow Diagram: Outline how data moves between modules within the system.

2. Design
Low-Fidelity Mockups: Initial wireframes showing basic layout and navigation.
High-Fidelity Designs: Detailed designs with visual elements, colors, and branding.
Prototype: Interactive demo to simulate core system functions for user feedback.

3. Development
Frontend: Build user interfaces using Angular, ensuring a responsive design.
Backend: Develop the system’s logic, including database handling and API integration.
Database Setup: Implement the database structure to support user, order, and component data.

4. Testing
Functional Testing: Verify core functions (e.g., orders, inventory, and user logins).
Non-Functional Testing: Test system performance, security, and usability.

5. Deployment
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Conduct UAT with real users to validate the system.
System Launch: Deploy the system to the production environment for public use.

## F. Benchmarking
  1. PCPartPicker – for build configurator and compatibility checking system

## G. Estimated Project Duration:
The project is estimated to take 6 months to complete, with 1 month dedicated to research and requirements gathering, 2 months to design and prototyping, 2 months to development, and 1 month for testing and deployment.
